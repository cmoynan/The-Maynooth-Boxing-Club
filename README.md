Welcome to my Maynooth Boxing club website. The Maynooth boxing website is aimed at getting people from the local commnuity of Maynooth and also neighbouring towns to get involved in Boxing while also getting fit. The site was created in order to give the boxing club owners a way of informing people on what classes are provided and also at what time they are on at while also giving users an option to contact them via a form or throguh their social media links.

FEATURES:

The website contains a fully functioning navigation bar.

Upon opening the website you see a clear header indicating what the website is and also a landing image with a description of what the club is about and who the owners of the club are.

Once you get by the about us section you come to the classes section. This gives the users the details of what classses are provided and at what times they are on. This allows the users know if times suit and also allows them choose what classes they would consider doing.

DESIGN:

Primary Color:
Black is chosen as the primary color. It symbolizes grit and determination. By using black as the primary color, the project aims to convey a sense of reliability and trustworthiness to users.

Accent Color:
White serves as the accent color to create contrast and highlight important elements on the website. 

Background image:
The background image used for the boxing website features someone engaged in training activities. This image was carefully selected to align with the theme and purpose of the website, which revolves around boxing and fitness. The color of the iage contracts well with the rest of the website

The webpage serves as a concise introduction to the club, allowing users to quickly familiarize themselves with its offerings and make contact for further information. By keeping the design simple and straightforward, users can easily navigate the site and access the information they need before reaching out. This approach enhances user convenience and ensures a seamless experience, encouraging engagement and interaction with the club.

I used the lighthouse function on devtools to test the performamce and accessibility of the website.

BUGS:

Lighthouse scroe was only 31% for perfromace. Mainly caused by the landing image being too large. Reduced the image size to correct this.

Accessibility score also below 90%. Added aria labels to the social media icons to bring the score above 90%

DEPLOYMENT:
The site was deployed to GITHUB pages. In the GitHub repository, I navigated to the Settings tab From the source section drop-down menu,I selected the Master Branch Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
