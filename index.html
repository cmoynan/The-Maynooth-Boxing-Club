              <em>
                Founded in 2019 Maynooth Boxing club was started by John Donovan and
                his wife Marlene. Both John and Marlene have competed at amateur level
                and both represented Ireland at numerous world Championships. John and
                Marlene are both from Maynooth. When they began boxing training they
                had to travel to Dublin city as there were no local boxing clubs close
                by. Since both have retired from competitive boxing their goal has
                been to setup a local boxing club in Maynooth. This became a reality
                in 2018 and since then they opened a fully equipped boxing gym that
                provides classes for all ages and all skill levels. Whether your goal
                is to just get fit or learn the beautiful science of boxing this is
                the gym that will cater for you.They gym operates on a pay as you go
                system so there is no commitment at all required and prices range
                depending on the classes that you attend. The first class for everyone
                is free. So come on down or get in touch using our contact form and we
                will get back to you.
