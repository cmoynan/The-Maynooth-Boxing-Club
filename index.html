                    <em>
                        Founded in 2019 Maynooth Boxing club was started by John Donovan and
                        his wife Marlene. Both John and Marlene have competed at amateur level
                        and both represented Ireland at numerous world Championships. John and
                        Marlene are both from Maynooth. When they began boxing training they
                        had to travel to Dublin city as there were no local boxing clubs close
                        by. Since both have retired from competitive boxing their goal has
                        been to setup a local boxing club in Maynooth. This became a reality
                        in 2018 and since then they opened a fully equipped boxing gym that
                        provides classes for all ages and all skill levels. Whether your goal
                        is to just get fit or learn the beautiful science of boxing this is
                        the gym that will cater for you.They gym operates on a pay as you go
                        system so there is no commitment at all required and prices range
