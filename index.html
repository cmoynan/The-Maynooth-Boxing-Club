            <p>
                <em>
                    Founded in 2019 Maynooth Boxing club was started by John Donovan and
                    his wife Marlene. Both John and Marlene have competed at amateur level
                    and both represented Ireland at numerous world Championships. John and
                    Marlene are both from Maynooth. When they began boxing training they
                    had to travel to Dublin city as there were no local boxing clubs close
                    by. Since both have retired from competitive boxing their goal has
                    been to setup a local boxing club in Maynooth. This became a reality
                    in 2018 and since then they opened a fully equipped boxing gym that
                    provides classes for all ages and all skill levels. Whether your goal
                    is to just get fit or learn the beautiful science of boxing this is
